## Milestone 1

Link to the description of the data source: https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/

Link to the data itself: https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/#collection/637218c173e9f0047faa00fb


Goal of the experiment: let us try to segment the different areas of the human heart

### 2. Other tasks regarding Milestone 1:
- Data visualization is in the Milestone_1 folder with recreatable gif-s for every single patient
- The data is prepared for training, we could feed it for a neural network
-  training, validation cuts are already available from scratch, we did not need to separate these

### Instruction to run files:
- Milestone_1/Human_Heart_Project_Visualization - working_dir needs to be specified and the specific subject to run the function for
- Milestone_1/First_model - Creatas a baseline model for this experiment, you have to specify the working directories

TODO: !A Requirements.txt is on the way, we just want to wait until we completed the whole task to upload it in one go!
