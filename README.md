## Milestone 1

### 1. Data Source
- [Link to the description of the data source](https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/)
- [Link to the data itself](https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/#collection/637218c173e9f0047faa00fb)

**Goal of the experiment:** The goal is to segment different areas of the human heart.

### 2. Other Tasks Regarding Milestone 1:
- Data visualization is in the `Milestone_1` folder with recreatable GIFs for every single patient.
- The data is prepared for training and can be fed into a neural network.
- Training and validation sets are already available from scratch, so no further separation is needed.

### Instruction to Run Files:
- `Milestone_1/Human_Heart_Project_Visualization`: You need to specify the working directory and the specific subject to run the function.
- `Milestone_1/First_model`: Creates a baseline model for this experiment. You need to specify the working directories.

## End Description
**TODO:** A `Requirements.txt` is on the way. We will upload it once the entire task is complete!
