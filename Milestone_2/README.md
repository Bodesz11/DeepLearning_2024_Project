# Deep Learning 2024 Project

## Milestone 2

### Goals for Milestone 2
- **Image Augmentation**: Improve model performance by applying data augmentation techniques to the input images.
- **Model Ensembling**: Train models with varied parameters and begin ensembling the outputs for better predictions.

### Instructions for Running the Files
1. **`train_model.py`**:
   - Ensure images are stored in the designated folder in the `X_.nii` format before running this script.

2. **`model_test_vis.ipynb`**:
   - Visualize predicted masks generated by the models. The notebook can load `.pt` files containing saved models.

3. **`model.pt`**:
   - This file contains the trained PyTorch model weights.

4. **`U-net_high_quality.png`**:
   - Displays the architecture of the U-Net model.

5. **`model_test.png`**:
   - Demonstrates the outputs of different models. You can download the pre-trained models for testing from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/f).

6. **`requirements.txt`**:
   - Lists all necessary packages and dependencies for running the project.

### Future Plans
- **Model Optimization**:
  - Use tools like [Weights & Biases (wandb.ai)](https://wandb.ai) to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

- **Enhanced Training**:
  - Integrate learning rate schedulers and early stopping mechanisms into the training process for more efficient learning.

- **Model Ensembling**:
  - Combine the predictions from the best-performing models to create an ensemble for improved accuracy and robustness.
