# DeepLearning 2024 Project

## Milestone 2

### 2. Tasks Regarding Milestone 1:
- We are trying to improve the performance of the model by addig augmentation to the images.


### Instruction to Run Files:
- `train_model.py`: The images must be in the specified folder in `X_.nii` format
- `model_test_vis.ipynb`: Creates a baseline model for this experiment. You need to specify the working directories.
- `model.pt`: Contain the saved pytorch model
